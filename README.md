### Selling

**Image:** `sellingHeader.jpg`

```html
<h4><strong>Selling</strong></h4>
<p>Selling your home can be stressful so it is important to choose an agent you can trust who will make this process as smooth as possible. We at [COMPANY NAME], aim to eliminate the stress and make the experience as easy as possible.</p><br />
<h4><strong>WHAT TO DO NEXT</strong></h4>
<p>Buying or selling a home? Do you require a valuation? Please contact [COMPANY NAME] for advice or fill in the [VALUATION FORM LINK].</p><br />
<p>In the meantime, here are a few guidelines which we hope will assist:</p><br />
<h4><strong>VALUATION</strong></h4>
<p>Firstly, if you are selling, you will require a valuation. At [COMPANY NAME] we can offer you a free, no obligation factual and accurate appraisal of the current market value of your home. Our experienced property valuers will provide you with a valuation based not only on their in depth knowledge of [LOCAL TOWN] and surrounding areas, but also utilising our extensive database of recent properties sold.</p><br />
<h4><strong>INSTRUCTION OF THE AGENT/PROPERTY DETAILS</strong></h4>
<p>Having received your valuation, and provided that you are satisfied with it, we will then proceed to prepare full sales details of your property. Bearing in mind the importance of presentation, we will ensure that your sales details highlight the vitally important aspects of your property and ensure that your home is shown to its best possible advantage with the aid of full colour photographs and, if required, we can also set up a computerised 360 degree/virtual tour to feature on our website.</p><br />
<h4><strong>MARKETING</strong></h4>
<p>Once you have seen and approved our particulars of your home, you will then be in a position to receive prospective buyers. Appointments to view your property are made by [COMPANY NAME] and accompanied viewing can also be arranged to show prospective buyers around your home should you be unable to do so.</p><br />
<p>Your property is now ready to market and we offer the following:</p><br />
<h4><strong>FOR SALES BOARD</strong></h4>
<p>This is the most simple and effective marketing tool, available 24 hours a day.</p><br />
<h4><strong>OFFICE AND WINDOW DISPLAY</strong></h4>
<p>External and internal photographs will be prominently displayed in our premises in order to optimise exposure to the market place.</p><br />
<h4><strong>EMAIL </strong></h4>
<p>Wherever possible, all prospective buyers who register with us are asked to provide email addresses in order to ensure that they are notified of any new properties as soon as possible within 24 hours of receiving your instruction.</p><br />
<h4><strong>MAIL SHOTS (and telesales)</strong></h4>
<p>We will contact registered prospective buyers as soon as possible after receiving your instruction and your details will be forwarded to any new registered buyers immediately.</p><br />
<h4><strong>WEBSITE</strong></h4>
<p>This is updated daily and full colour details of your home are placed on our website within 24 hours of being placed on the market.</p><br />
<p>We also have an optional 360 degree/virtual our which can assist to further enhance your property.</p><br />
<p>Besides the exposure on our own site, [COMPANY NAME] is also affiliated with the following national property websites which will feature your home:</p><br />
<p>[PORTAL LIST]</p><br />
<h4><strong>UPDATING ON YOUR SALE</strong></h4>
<p>At [COMPANY NAME], we pride ourselves on our conscientious sales management. We aim to keep you regularly appraised of your sales process right through to completion and liaise with your purchaser, the legal representatives, surveyors and mortgage lenders in order to ensure that your sale is progressed as smoothly and as stress-free as possible.</p><br />
<h4><strong>OFFERS</strong></h4>
<p>Any offers we receive are promptly verbally notified and then followed up in writing. Our competent sales team will negotiate between you and your prospective applicant in order to achieve the strongest buyer.</p><br />
<p>We will inform you of the position of the buyers and liaise with you until an accepted offer has been agreed.</p><br />
<p>Should you require your sale to be completed by a certain date, this is when you should notify us and we will endeavour to satisfy your request wherever possible.</p><br />
<p>At this stage, you should also provide your list of Fixture and Fittings which will be negotiated separately between the solicitors and forms part of the final contract.</p><br />
<h4><strong>AGREED SALE</strong></h4>
<p>At this point (if you have not already done so), you will need to instruct a solicitor and, should you require assistance, [COMPANY NAME] will only be too pleased to recommend local firms.</p><br />
<p>The solicitors will then write to all parties and the buyers will instruct a surveyor to conduct a survey of your property (the “agreed sale” is subject to the contract and any survey) and the buyers’ mortgage offer (if required) will also be subject to the results of the survey.</p><br />
<p>The sellers’ solicitors will request the TITLE DEEDS from the lender (if appropriate) or yourselves as the seller and the FIXTURES AND FITTINGS form must be completed at this stage.</p><br />
<p>The solicitors draw up the DRAFT CONTRACT which sets of the Terms of the Sale and sends it to the buyers’ solicitor together with all relevant documents. Any enquiries will then be raised, the Title Deeds and Lease (if applicable) will be checked and LOCAL SEARCHES carried out.</p><br />
<p>Once the draft contracts have been approved, it can be signed by both parties.</p><br />
<h4><strong>EXCHANGE OF CONTRACTS</strong></h4>
<p>As long as the mortgage offer has been received and cleared funds placed with your buyer’s solicitor, a mutually convenient date can be agreed upon for the exchange of contracts.</p><br />
<h4><strong>COMPLETION </strong></h4>
<p>The completion and your actual house move and take between 7 to 28 days depending on the buyers, sellers and their respective solicitors.</p>

### Tenant Information

**Image:** `tenantHeader.jpg`

```html
<h4><strong>Tenant Information</strong></h4>
<p>At [COMPANY NAME], we let and manage a variety of furnished and unfurnished properties throughout [LOCAL TOWN] and [LOCAL COUNTY] for rent. As members of the [LIST ASSOCIATIONS] all security deposits are held in a designated Clients Account and fully bonded.</p><br />
<p>Our site contains a constantly updated register of rental property. CLICK HERE [WEB LINK] to see our latest list. In order to receive a regularly updated list of our available rental properties, please register [REGISTRATION FORM LINK] and we will contact you with details of new properties to suit your specified requirements.</p><br />
<p>For more detailed information or appointments to view please contact us on [CONTACT TEL NO].</p><br />
<p>Please keep in mind that a range of rigorous checks on all prospective tenants will be carried out and we will require at least one full month’s rent as a deposit and one month’s rent paid in advance. Should you be uncertain as to your suitability or have specific requirements, please contact us.</p><br />
<h4><strong>TENANT'S GUIDE</strong></h4>
<p>Although Letting Agents have different procedures, this guide is intended as a general overview to assist you when renting a property. We have set out below a few significant pointers to assist you.</p><br />
<h4><strong>YOUR OFFER</strong></h4>
<p>Once we have found your suitable property, you will be in a position to make an offer to the Landlord for consideration. Please note that any offer you make would be subject to you fulfilling our reference criteria.</p><br />
<p>At this point, you will be requested to provide a RESERVATION FEE which holds the property for you. However, if the Tenancy Agreement is not signed by you (the Tenant) within 7 to 14 working days after receipt of your application, the Landlord reserves the right to re-offer the property. In these circumstances or, should your references prove unsatisfactory, the reservation/application fee would be non-refundable.</p><br />
<h4><strong>AGREEING THE LET</strong></h4>
<p>As soon as your offer has been accepted by the Landlord, we will apply for references and draw up the relevant documentation which will form the basis of the agreement between you and the Landlord.</p><br />
<h4><strong>YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE:</strong></h4><br />
<h4><strong>IDENTIFICATION/PROOF OF RESIDENCY</strong></h4>
<p>All tenants must show proof of address. Only the following forms of identification are accepted:</p><br />
<ul>
    <li>Utility bill (less than 3 months old)</li>
    <li>Full driving license</li>
    <li>Council tax bill (less than 3 months old)</li>
    <li>Mobile phone bill (less than 3 months old)</li>
</ul><br />
<h4><strong>REFERENCES</strong></h4>
<p>We will also contact your employer and your landlord (if you are in rented accommodation already. Your previous employer will also be contacted if you have recently changed jobs. If you are self-employed, we will need to contact your accountant. A credit check will also be conducted.</p><br />
<p>To assist us in collating the necessary references, it would be advantageous for you to warn the above individuals in advance that references are required as these can be return to us within a matter of a few days, barring any delays.</p><br />
<p>Occasionally, a GUARANTOR will be required if, for example the tenant has not been continuously employed for the past 18 months; has been working abroad in the previous 6 months; the tenants’ income falls short of our criteria or the tenants’ employment is considered as changeable.</p><br />
<p>Please note that the same criteria apply to the guarantor and, furthermore, the guarantor must earn the equivalent of 3 times the yearly sum of the rent, be in full time employment or be able to prove by bank statements that they have “independent means”. All tenants should be able to provide a guarantor and should the tenant be unable to provide one, we will decide that the tenant has withdrawn their application. The tenant will therefore forfeit their deposit.</p><br />
<p>The guarantor must be aware that they will stand as guarantor for you, (and your partner if you are moving in to the property with some one else), for the entire occupancy of the property, not just for the period of the initial tenancy term.</p><br />
<h4><strong>HOW MUCH DO I NEED TO EARN TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE PROPERTY?</strong></h4>
<p>Having passed all the referencing criteria to be considered for the property and, subject to the Landlord’s decision, you must earn at least 1.5 times the yearly rent (however, you will require a guarantor) or at least 2.5 times the yearly rent (you will qualify on the income part of the referencing without a guarantor).</p><br />
<h4><strong>TENANCY AGREEMENT</strong></h4>
<p>An appointment will be arranged with you to visit our offices to sign the Tenancy Agreement when all references have been received. The Landlord will also be asked to sign their copy of the document.</p><br />
<h4><strong>RENT AND DEPOSIT</strong></h4>
<p>You will be required to provide the agreed sum of rent and deposit before taking possession of the property.</p><br />
<p>The deposit is required for the full tenancy against loss, damage or charges payable at the termination of the tenancy. Whilst this is usually the equivalent of one month’s rent, this may vary therefore we suggest that the actual amount is verified via the property description as found on our letting list. The deposit will be held by [COMPANY NAME] in their designated clients’ account and is fully bonded. It is returnable in full at the end of the tenancy subject to final inspection of the property and it should be noted that deductions will also be made for cleaning should the property (and garden areas) not have been left in a satisfactory condition.</p><br />
<p>Rent is to be paid monthly in advance commencing on the first day of the tenancy and then on the same day each month thereafter. The preferred method is by bank standing order.</p><br />
<h4><strong>FEES</strong></h4>
<p>We charge an application fee of £ [LETTING APPLICATION FEE] including VAT which is non-refundable, even if a tenancy is refused on the grounds of references or if the tenant withdraws from taking the property. Where there are more than two tenants an additional amount per tenant inclusive of VAT will be charged. A fee of £ [LETTING RENEWAL FEE] including VAT is charged to the tenant for renewal of all fixed term tenancies.</p><br />
<h4><strong>COMPANY LET</strong></h4>
<p>Company applications are acceptable where the company will be paying the rent. The fee will be £ [COMPANY LETTING APPLICATION FEE] plus VAT.</p><br />
<p>Please note that all monies to be paid on the signing of the agreement prior to the occupation and should be paid in cash or by banker’s draft, unless they are paid a minimum of seven working days prior to occupancy.</p><br />
<h4><strong>CHECK IN AND CONDITION REPORT</strong></h4>
<p>If we have been instructed by the Landlord, a Condition Report will be prepared of your new home and a convenient appointment will be made with the Inventory Clerk to carry out a Check In report to coincide with your move in day.</p><br />
<p>All information is provided in good faith. It does not replace the advice of a qualified legal advisor. We will accept no responsibility for any inaccuracies.</p><br />
<h4><strong>OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST:</strong></h4><br />
<ol>
    <li>The Tenant will be responsible for insuring their own possessions.</li>
    <li>The Tenant will take over all utilities such as Gas, Electricity, Water/Sewage charges, Council Tax & Telephone upon moving into the property and will be responsible for contacting the relevant suppliers accordingly prior to commencement of the tenancy.</li>
    <li>The Landlord is responsible for any repair/maintenance problems to appliances etc. but the Tenant is responsible for any breakages which should be reported immediately.</li>
    <li>Decoration of the property must only be done with your Landlord’s permission.</li>
    <li>No pets are allowed unless the Landlord has given consent.</li>
    <li>Reasonable notice should be given in the event that the Letting Agent or Landlord wishes to inspect the property outside pre-agreed times. It is usual for the Agent to inspect the property at least twice during the term of your Tenancy and the Tenancy Agreement should cover this eventuality.</li>
    <li>Most lets are for 12 months, although some Landlords may consider shorter terms of say 6 months.</li>
    <li>Should you wish to quit your Tenancy earlier than the agreed term, you will be liable for all rent until the end of the agreed Tenancy. However, it may be worth considering negotiating a BREAK CLAUSE with the Landlord which, for example, could entitle you to give notice after 4 months.<br />In this case, you would only be liable for the rent for the notice period of 2 months, releasing you from the remaining 6 months of a 12-month Tenancy.</li>
    <li>There is no set law regarding the time limit for returning deposits but this is normally subsequent to the final inspection of the property. Letting agents generally encourage Landlords to employ a professional inventory agent to conduct the inspection and produce a report as to the condition of the interior at the beginning of the Tenancy and again at the end but this is not obligatory. In most cases, the deposit will be returned once any damages are ascertained by the Tenant/Landlord/Inventory Clerk and appropriate deductions agreed.</li>
    <li>The most common type of Tenancy Agreement is the assured short hold used for 6-12 month lets and usually takes the form of a standard contract between both parties.<br />However, should any “extras” be agreed such as certain furnishings to be provided by the Landlord, you should ask that an extra clause be added to the agreement to this effect. It should be noted that the landlord is not obliged to carry out promises so it is important that your requests are documented.</li>
    <li>The Letting Agents will deal with the property viewings, references, agreements and getting you moved in. If the agent has been instructed to manage the property, then you will normally report any repairs or queries to them. If not, then you will deal directly with the Landlord.</li>
    <li>The Letting Agent, whilst acting for the Landlord, operates within accepted guidelines in the industry to ensure that you are able to rely on a professional letting agent taking your concerns seriously and advising the Landlord if they are being unreasonable. In this regard, you should be assured that the property conforms to all safety regulations and is fairly priced.</li>
    <li>You require a professional service and, as such, [COMPANY NAME] is a member of a recognised body such as [ACCREDITED ORGANISATIONS]. This ensures that professional standards are met, for example, the correct Tenancy Agreement is used; proper procedures are in place for reporting and dealing with repairs; safety checks are conducted and a bonding scheme is provided to protect your deposit.</li>
