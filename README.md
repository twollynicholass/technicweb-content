### About Us Content

```html
<p><strong>Technicweb Ltd was founded in 2003 by Andrew Clack and Charles Forrester; Andrew, an Ex-Estate Agent with over 15 years experience and Charles coming from NetCall PLC; a technology company specialising in web-based telephony systems.</strong></p>
<p>Charles was appointed as Technical Director to design the <a href="http://www.technicweb.com/estate-agency-cms">estate agency software</a>, (Estateweb)&nbsp;which would power all the websites the company created and Andrew had the responsibility for setting up and developing the sales side of the business.</p>
<p>On the day we opened the company we were a team of just five people rattling around in a 2500 sq ft office but as we grew, it became evident we could not each do 6 jobs so gradually we replaced ‘roles’ with staff to look after our clients and get the websites built. </p>
<p>We quickly realised that Estate Agents would not manually upload their properties to their own websites if this was duplicating work so we created a product called ‘<a href="http://www.technicweb.com/Data-Integration-software">Bridge</a>’ which automatically synchronised their own office software with their website. The very first installation being Property PRO for Lawlors*; our first client! </p>
<p>Over the years we have built over 1000 property websites which has exposed us to just about every situation imaginable; from single branch residential to large multi-disciplined agencies – one could say we’ve been through a very long learning curve but the good news is for any client who commissions us today – we have substantial to experience to impart and ready-made solutions for just about anything related to property websites.</p>
